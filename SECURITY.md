## 🔐 Security

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**IMPORTANT**: Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Email **your-email@example.com** with details
2. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. We will respond within **24 hours**
4. We will work with you on a fix before public disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit you if you wish!

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users

- ✅ Use strong Google passwords
- ✅ Keep your browser updated
- ✅ Only use HTTPS URLs in production
- ✅ Don't share your Firebase credentials
- ✅ Enable 2FA on your Google account

#### For Developers

- ✅ Never commit `.env` file to Git
- ✅ Rotate Firebase keys periodically
- ✅ Use environment-specific credentials
- ✅ Review Firebase Security Rules regularly
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated: `npm audit fix`
- ✅ Validate all user input
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production

### Firebase Security Rules Template

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        // Only the user can read their own data
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        // Only the user can write their own data
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid",
        // Data must exist before writing
        ".validate": "auth !== null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Dependency Security

Check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# See vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Automatically fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check specific package
npm audit --package [package-name]
```

## 📋 Responsible Disclosure Timeline

1. **Immediate**: We acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **24 hours**: We provide initial assessment
3. **48 hours**: We begin development of a fix
4. **Timeline based on severity**:
   - **Critical**: Fix within 24-48 hours
   - **High**: Fix within 3-5 days
   - **Medium**: Fix within 1-2 weeks
   - **Low**: Fix in next release

5. **Disclosure**: Fixed version released + credit given
